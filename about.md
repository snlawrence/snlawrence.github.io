# About Me
I'm Sean and I am in my final year of a PhD with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. My research is an experimental investigation in fluid mechanics, looking at the effect of surface roughness on wake flows. I joined the Laboratory for Turbulence Research and Combustion after graduating top of my class, but not before taking 3 months to travel Europe.

I'm driven by a desire to improve myself and combine my experience and skills in interesting, novel and effective ways. As a PhD researcher I enjoy being able to explore new ideas and being forced to constantly learn new skills and knowledge. The autonomy I have to deep dive on interesting topics and projects keeps me curious and means I'm continuously learning and honing skills.

With the conclusion of my PhD drawing near, I have begun pondering where I might want to go with my career and what a fulfilling career might look like for me. I'm currently exploring a range of options for my next career step that would lead me down a path to doing meaningful and impactful work.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with electronics and IoT type applications, woodworking, Stoic philosophy, hiking, running and cycling.
